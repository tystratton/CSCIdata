Welcome to the blockchain message digest system!
This is the first user message in our blockchain.
Digital signatures ensure message authenticity.
Blockchain technology provides immutable record keeping.
Each block contains a cryptographic hash of the previous block.
This creates a secure chain of data integrity.
Tampering with any block will break the chain validation.
The system uses timestamps as nonce values for uniqueness.
