they are at CERN, Phone +41(22)767 plus the extension given below
or look them up in the <A NAME=14 HREF=http://crnvmc.cern.ch./WHO>phone book</A> . Address: 1211 Geneva 23, Switzerland.

<H2>Eelco van Asperen</H2>Ported the line-mode browser the PC under PC-NFS; developed a curses
version. Email: evas@cs.few.eur.nl.
<H2><A NAME=11>Carl Barker</A></H2>Carl is at CERN for a six month period during his degree course at
Brunel University, UK.  Carl will be working on the server side, possibly
on client authentication. Tel: 8265.  Email: barker@cernnext.cern.ch
<H2><A NAME=BernersLee>Tim Berners-Lee</A></H2>Currently in CN division. Before comming to CERN, Tim worked on, among
other things, document production and text processing. He developped
his first hypertext system, "Enquire", in 1980 for his own use (although
unaware of the existence of the term HyperText). With a background
in text processing, real-time software and communications, Tim decided
that high energy physics needed a networked hypertext system and CERN
was an ideal site for the development of wide-area hypertext ideas.
Tim started the <A NAME=0 HREF=TheProject.html>WorldWideWeb</A> project at CERN in 1989. He wrote the<A NAME=2 HREF=NeXT/WorldWideWeb.html>
application on the NeXT</A> along with most of the communications software.
Phone: 3755, Email: timbl@info.cern.ch
<H2><A NAME=Cailliau>Robert Cailliau</A></H2>Formerly in programming language design and compiler construction,
Robert has been interested in document production since 1975, when
he designed and implemented a widely used document markup and formatting
system. He ran CERN's Office Computing Systems group from 87 to 89.
He is a long-time user of Hypercard, which he used to such diverse
ends as writing trip reports, games, bookkeeping software, and budget
preparation forms. When he is not doing WWW's public relations, Robert
is contributing browser software for the Macintosh platform, and analysing
the needs of physics experiments for online data access. Phone: +41
(22) 767 50 05, Email: cailliau@cernnext.cern.ch
<H2>Dan Connolly</H2>An early follower of the project, Dan wrote a private X-Windows editor
for his company, and encouraged the use of proper SGML and MIME in
the future. He wrote a <A NAME=15 HREF=MarkUp/HTML.dtd>DTD for HTML</A> and an <A NAME=16 HREF=Tools/HTMLGeneration/fix-html.pl>HTML legalizer</A> for old
files. Email: connolly@pixel.convex.com.
<H2>Peter Dobberstein</H2>While at the DESY lab in Hamburg (DE),  Peter did the port of the
line-mode browser onto MVS and, indirectly, VM/CMS. These were the
most difficult of the ports to date. He also overcame many incidental
problems in making a large amount of information in the <A NAME=6 HREF=http://crnvmc.cern.ch/FIND/DESY?>DESY database</A>
available. 
<H2><A NAME=9>"Erwise" team</A></H2>Kim Nyberg, Teemu Rantanen, Kati Suominen and Kari Syd{nmaanlakka
('{' is 'a' with two dots above it.. we must get some character set
description into HTML!)   (under the supervision of Ari Lemmke)  are
"Erwise".  At Helsinki Technical University, they  are writing a Motif-based
WWW browser (editor? we can hope...) for their undergraduate final
year project. The team can be reached as erwise@cs.hut.fi and Ari
as arl@cs.hut.fi.
<H2>Alain Favre</H2>Alain is an undergraduate  working with ECP/PT on a browser for Windows
on PCs. Phone: 8265, no email yet.  In CERN mostly in the afternoons.
<H2>David Foster</H2>With wide experience in networking, and a current conviction information
systems and PC/Windows being the way of the future, Dave is having
a go at a MS-Windows browser/editor. Dave also has a strong interest
in server technology and intelligent information retrieval algorithms.
<H2><A NAME=Groff>Jean-Francois Groff</A></H2>Provided some useful input in the "design issues". During his stay
at CERN as "cooperant", J-F joined the project in September 1991.
He wrote the<A NAME=5 HREF=VMSHelp/Overview.html> gateway to the VMS Help system</A> , worked on the new modular
browser architecure, and helped support and present WWW at all levels.
He is now porting the communications code to DECnet in order to set
up servers for physics experiments.  JF now works for NeXT Europe
but continues his interest in the web...(<A NAME=23 HREF=People/Groff.html> Contact</A> )

<H1>WWW people</H1>This is a list of some of those who have contributed to the <A NAME=7 HREF=TheProject.html>WWW project</A>
, and whose work is linked into this web. Unless otherwise stated
they are at CERN, Phone +41(22)767 plus the extension given below
or look them up in the <A NAME=14 HREF=http://crnvmc.cern.ch./WHO>phone book</A> . Address: 1211 Geneva 23, Switzerland.
See also: <A NAME=12 HREF=http://slacvm.slac.stanford.edu:80/FIND/wizards.html>Wizards at SLAC</A> .
<H2>Eelco van Asperen</H2>Ported the line-mode browser the PC under PC-NFS; developed a curses
version. Email: evas@cs.few.eur.nl.
<H2><A NAME=11>Carl Barker</A></H2>Carl is at CERN for a six month period during his degree course at
Brunel University, UK.  Carl will be working on the server side, possibly
on client authentication. Tel: 8265.  Email: barker@cernnext.cern.ch
<H2><A NAME=BernersLee>Tim Berners-Lee</A></H2>Currently in CN division. Before comming to CERN, Tim worked on, among
other things, document production and text processing. He developped
his first hypertext system, "Enquire", in 1980 for his own use (although
unaware of the existence of the term HyperText). With a background
in text processing, real-time software and communications, Tim decided
that high energy physics needed a networked hypertext system and CERN
was an ideal site for the development of wide-area hypertext ideas.
Tim started the <A NAME=0 HREF=TheProject.html>WorldWideWeb</A> project at CERN in 1989. He wrote the<A NAME=2 HREF=NeXT/WorldWideWeb.html>
application on the NeXT</A> along with most of the communications software.
Phone: 3755, Email: timbl@info.cern.ch
<H2><A NAME=Cailliau>Robert Cailliau</A></H2>Formerly in programming language design and compiler construction,
Robert has been interested in document production since 1975, when
he designed and implemented a widely used document markup and formatting
system. He ran CERN's Office Computing Systems group from 87 to 89.
He is a long-time user of Hypercard, which he used to such diverse
ends as writing trip reports, games, bookkeeping software, and budget
preparation forms. When he is not doing WWW's public relations, Robert
is contributing browser software for the Macintosh platform, and analysing
the needs of physics experiments for online data access. Phone: +41
(22) 767 50 05, Email: cailliau@cernnext.cern.ch
<H2>Dan Connolly</H2>An early follower of the project, Dan wrote a private X-Windows editor
for his company, and encouraged the use of proper SGML and MIME in
the future. He wrote a <A NAME=15 HREF=MarkUp/HTML.dtd>DTD for HTML</A> and an <A NAME=16 HREF=Tools/HTMLGeneration/fix-html.pl>HTML legalizer</A> for old
files. Email: connolly@pixel.convex.com.
<H2>Peter Dobberstein</H2>While at the DESY lab in Hamburg (DE),  Peter did the port of the
line-mode browser onto MVS and, indirectly, VM/CMS. These were the
most difficult of the ports to date. He also overcame many incidental
problems in making a large amount of information in the <A NAME=6 HREF=http://crnvmc.cern.ch/FIND/DESY?>DESY database</A>
available. 
<H2><A NAME=9>"Erwise" team</A></H2>Kim Nyberg, Teemu Rantanen, Kati Suominen and Kari Syd{nmaanlakka
('{' is 'a' with two dots above it.. we must get some character set
description into HTML!)   (under the supervision of Ari Lemmke)  are
"Erwise".  At Helsinki Technical University, they  are writing a Motif-based
WWW browser (editor? we can hope...) for their undergraduate final
year project. The team can be reached as erwise@cs.hut.fi and Ari
as arl@cs.hut.fi.
<H2>Alain Favre</H2>Alain is an undergraduate  working with ECP/PT on a browser for Windows
on PCs. Phone: 8265, no email yet.  In CERN mostly in the afternoons.
<H2>David Foster</H2>With wide experience in networking, and a current conviction information
systems and PC/Windows being the way of the future, Dave is having
a go at a MS-Windows browser/editor. Dave also has a strong interest
in server technology and intelligent information retrieval algorithms.
<H2><A NAME=Groff>Jean-Francois Groff</A></H2>Provided some useful input in the "design issues". During his stay
at CERN as "cooperant", J-F joined the project in September 1991.
He wrote the<A NAME=5 HREF=VMSHelp/Overview.html> gateway to the VMS Help system</A> , worked on the new modular
browser architecure, and helped support and present WWW at all levels.
He is now porting the communications code to DECnet in order to set
up servers for physics experiments.  JF now works for NeXT Europe
but continues his interest in the web...(<A NAME=23 HREF=People/Groff.html> Contact</A> )

<TITLE>Protocol Specifications relevant to HyperText</TITLE>
<NEXTID 18>
<H1>Relevant protocols</H1>The <A NAME=0 HREF=../TheProject.html>WorldWideWeb</A> system can pick up information from many information
sources, using existing protocols. Among these are file and news transfer
protocols.
<H2><A NAME=11>File Transfer</A></H2>The file transfer protocol currently most used for accessing fairly
stable public information over a wide area is "Anonymous FTP". This
means the use of the internet File Transfer Protocol without authentication.
As the WWW project currently operates for the sake of public information,
anonymous FTP is quite appropriate, and WWW can pick up any information
provided by anonymous FTP. FTP is defined in<A NAME=1 HREF=rfc959.txt> RFC 959</A> which includes
material from many previous RFCs. (See also: <A NAME=2 HREF=../Addressing/FileAddressing.html> file address syntax</A>
). Directories are browsed as hypertext.  The browser will notice
references to files which are in fact accessible as locally mounted
(or on DECnet on VMS systems) and use direct access instead.<P>
See also the prospero project and the <A NAME=10 HREF=../../../Shift/shift0-4.dvi>shift</A> project, for more powerful
file access systems.
<H2>Network News</H2>The "Network News Transfer Protocol" (NNTP) is defined in<A NAME=3 HREF=rfc977.txt> RFC 977</A>
by Kantor and Lampsley. This allows transient news information in
the USENET news format to be exchanged over the internet. The format
of news articles is defined in<A NAME=4 HREF=rfc850.txt> RFC 850, Standard for Interchange of
USENET Messages</A> by Mark Horton. This in turn refers to the standard<A NAME=5 HREF=rfc822.txt>
RFC 822</A> which defines the format of internet mail messages. News articles
make good examples of hypertext, as articles contain references to
other articles and news groups. News groups appear like directories,
but more informative.
<H2>Search and Retrieve</H2>The WWW project defines its own protocol for information transfer,
called HTTP, for <A NAME=9 HREF=HTTP/AsImplemented.html>HyperText Transfer Protocol</A>. HTTP is a very simple
internet protocol, similar in implementation to FTP and NNTP.  The
HTTP client sends a <A NAME=17 HREF=../Addressing/Addressing.html>document identifier</A> with or without search words,
and the server responds with hypertext or plain text. Extensions are
foreseen to allow for more elaborate queries and <A NAME=16 HREF=../DesignIssues/Formats.html#4>format negotiation</A>.
The protocol runs over TCP, using one connection per document request.
The browser acts as a pipeline, so that as data arrives from the server,
it is presented to the reader on the fly.<P>
Whilst the <A NAME=12 HREF=HTTP.html>HTTP</A> protocol provides a simple keyword search function,
a famous search-and-retrieve protocol is Z39.50, and the version of
it used by the <A NAME=13 HREF=../../Products/WAIS/Overview.html>WAIS</A> project.  (See also the WAIS-WWW <A NAME=14 HREF=../Daemon/WAISGate.html>gateway</A>).
<H2>Gopher</H2>The Gopher distributed information system uses a lightweight <A NAME=15 HREF=../../Gopher/gopher_protocol/protocol.rtf>protocol</A>
very similar to HTTP. Therefore, it is now included in every WWW client,
so that the Gopher world can be browsed as part of the Web. Gopher
menus are easily mapped onto hypertext links. Chances are that future
versions of the Gopher and HTTP protocols will converge.

Whilst the <A NAME=12 HREF=HTTP.html>HTTP</A> protocol provides a simple keyword search function,
a famous search-and-retrieve protocol is Z39.50, and the version of
it used by the <A NAME=13 HREF=../../Products/WAIS/Overview.html>WAIS</A> project.  (See also the WAIS-WWW <A NAME=14 HREF=../Daemon/WAISGate.html>gateway</A>).
<H2>Gopher</H2>The Gopher distributed information system uses a lightweight <A NAME=15 HREF=../../Gopher/gopher_protocol/protocol.rtf>protocol</A>
very similar to HTTP. Therefore, it is now included in every WWW client,
so that the Gopher world can be browsed as part of the Web. Gopher
menus are easily mapped onto hypertext links. Chances are that future
versions of the Gopher and HTTP protocols will converge.

<TITLE>People involved in the WorldWideWeb project</TITLE>
<NEXTID 26>
<H1>WWW people</H1>This is a list of some of those who have contributed to the <A NAME=7 HREF=TheProject.html>WWW project</A>
, and whose work is linked into this web. Unless otherwise stated
they are at CERN, Phone +41(22)767 plus the extension given below
or look them up in the <A NAME=14 HREF=http://crnvmc.cern.ch./WHO>phone book</A> . Address: 1211 Geneva 23, Switzerland.
See also: <A NAME=12 HREF=http://slacvm.slac.stanford.edu:80/FIND/wizards.html>Wizards at SLAC</A> .
<H2>Eelco van Asperen</H2>Ported the line-mode browser the PC under PC-NFS; developed a curses
version. Email: evas@cs.few.eur.nl.
<H2><A NAME=11>Carl Barker</A></H2>Carl is at CERN for a six month period during his degree course at
Brunel University, UK.  Carl will be working on the server side, possibly
on client authentication. Tel: 8265.  Email: barker@cernnext.cern.ch
<H2><A NAME=BernersLee>Tim Berners-Lee</A></H2>Currently in CN division. Before comming to CERN, Tim worked on, among
other things, document production and text processing. He developped
his first hypertext system, "Enquire", in 1980 for his own use (although
unaware of the existence of the term HyperText). With a background
in text processing, real-time software and communications, Tim decided
that high energy physics needed a networked hypertext system and CERN
was an ideal site for the development of wide-area hypertext ideas.
Tim started the <A NAME=0 HREF=TheProject.html>WorldWideWeb</A> project at CERN in 1989. He wrote the<A NAME=2 HREF=NeXT/WorldWideWeb.html>
application on the NeXT</A> along with most of the communications software.
Phone: 3755, Email: timbl@info.cern.ch
<H2><A NAME=Cailliau>Robert Cailliau</A></H2>Formerly in programming language design and compiler construction,
Robert has been interested in document production since 1975, when
he designed and implemented a widely used document markup and formatting
system. He ran CERN's Office Computing Systems group from 87 to 89.
He is a long-time user of Hypercard, which he used to such diverse
ends as writing trip reports, games, bookkeeping software, and budget
preparation forms. When he is not doing WWW's public relations, Robert
is contributing browser software for the Macintosh platform, and analysing
the needs of physics experiments for online data access. Phone: +41
(22) 767 50 05, Email: cailliau@cernnext.cern.ch
<H2>Dan Connolly</H2>An early follower of the project, Dan wrote a private X-Windows editor
for his company, and encouraged the use of proper SGML and MIME in
the future. He wrote a <A NAME=15 HREF=MarkUp/HTML.dtd>DTD for HTML</A> and an <A NAME=16 HREF=Tools/HTMLGeneration/fix-html.pl>HTML legalizer</A> for old
files. Email: connolly@pixel.convex.com.
<H2>Peter Dobberstein</H2>While at the DESY lab in Hamburg (DE),  Peter did the port of the
line-mode browser onto MVS and, indirectly, VM/CMS. These were the
most difficult of the ports to date. He also overcame many incidental
problems in making a large amount of information in the <A NAME=6 HREF=http://crnvmc.cern.ch/FIND/DESY?>DESY database</A>
available. 
<H2><A NAME=9>"Erwise" team</A></H2>Kim Nyberg, Teemu Rantanen, Kati Suominen and Kari Syd{nmaanlakka
('{' is 'a' with two dots above it.. we must get some character set
description into HTML!)   (under the supervision of Ari Lemmke)  are
"Erwise".  At Helsinki Technical University, they  are writing a Motif-based
WWW browser (editor? we can hope...) for their undergraduate final
year project. The team can be reached as erwise@cs.hut.fi and Ari
as arl@cs.hut.fi.
<H2>Alain Favre</H2>Alain is an undergraduate  working with ECP/PT on a browser for Windows
on PCs. Phone: 8265, no email yet.  In CERN mostly in the afternoons.
<H2>David Foster</H2>With wide experience in networking, and a current conviction information
systems and PC/Windows being the way of the future, Dave is having
a go at a MS-Windows browser/editor. Dave also has a strong interest
in server technology and intelligent information retrieval algorithms.
<H2><A NAME=Groff>Jean-Francois Groff</A></H2>Provided some useful input in the "design issues". During his stay
at CERN as "cooperant", J-F joined the project in September 1991.
He wrote the<A NAME=5 HREF=VMSHelp/Overview.html> gateway to the VMS Help system</A> , worked on the new modular
browser architecure, and helped support and present WWW at all levels.
He is now porting the communications code to DECnet in order to set
up servers for physics experiments.  JF now works for NeXT Europe
but continues his interest in the web...(<A NAME=23 HREF=People/Groff.html> Contact</A> )

<TITLE>Language -- /Project</TITLE>
<NEXTID 7>
<H1>Language features</H1>Code to be common shared code must (unfortunately!) be written in
C, rather than any objective C or C++, to ensure maximum portability.
This section does not apply to code written for specific platforms.<P>
C code must compile under either a conforming ANSI C compiler OR an
original Kernighan & Ritchie C compiler. Therefore, the __STDC__ macro
must be used to select alternative code where necessary.. (<A NAME=1 HREF=Ex_Heading.html> example</A>
)<P>
Code should compile without warnings under an ANSI C compiler such
as gcc with all warnings enabled.
<DL>
<DT>Parameters and Arguments
<DD> The <A NAME=3 HREF=Macros.html#1>PARAMS(()) macro</A>  is used to give a format
parameter list in a declataion so that it will be suppressed if the
compiler is not standard C - see <A NAME=4 HREF=Ex_Heading.html>example</A> ..  The ARGS1 macro is for
the declaration of the implementation,  taking first the type then
the argument name. For n arguments, macros <A NAME=5 HREF=Macros.html#9>ARGn</A> exists taking 2n arguments
each.
<DT>#endif
<DD> Do put the ending condition in a comment. Don't put  it as
code - it won't pass all compilers. 
<DT>#elif
<DD>Don't use it. Basic cpp doesn't know it.
<DT>#preprocessor statements
<DD> DON'T indent any preprocessor statements.
They must (for some compilers) begin in column 1.
<DT>const
<DD> This keyword does not exist in K&R C, so use the macro <A NAME=6 HREF=Macros.html#10>CONST</A>
which expands to "const" under standard C and nothing otherwise. --
See HTUtils.h
