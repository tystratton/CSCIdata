1. Which hash table seems to find things faster? Do you notice a difference?
I actually asked AI to implement chrono and timed each to see which hash table was faster with nums.txt.

With Quadratic Probing I got - 0.0464477, and chaining separately was 0.19422.

2. Which hash table was easier to implement?
Separate chaining had simpler logic. You just hash the key and add to the end of the linked list.
Plus the standard library list handles all the memory management.

When I made quadratic it required state tracking, and edge cases could cause table overflow so I 
had to handle that. 

3. Do you think changing the probing technique could help the first hash tree?
Quadratic probing is already 4x faster than chaining in this test so I'm assuming the improvement
would be marginal.
